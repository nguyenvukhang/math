title: 'Lemma 1.26 (Weak Duality for matchings)'
---

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. For any matching $M$ on $G$ and any vertex
cover $U$ on $G$ we have $|M|\leq|U|$.

The number of matchings is bounded above by the size of the largest
vertex cover.

_Proof._ Every edge $e\in M$ must be covered by one of its two
endpoints in $U$, and no single vertex can cover two edges in $M$.
