Form: $y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=r(x)$

And we already know that $y_1$ is a solution.

Define $v(x)$ by $\displaystyle y=y_1(x)v(x)$. Use this

Then we will have

$$
v''y_1+v'(2y_1'+py_1)=0
$$

Which is a first-order linear equation in $v'$. Use $u:=v'$ to solve
for $u$ and then substitute everything back to find $y$.
