Let $\gamma$ be the boundary of a disc $D(z_0,r)$ in the complex
plane, equipped with the counterclockwise orientation. Let $z$ be a
point inside the circle $\partial D(z_0,r)$. Then

$$
\frac1{2\pi i}\oint_\gamma\frac1{\zeta-z}\,d\zeta = 1
$$

The proof involves considering the function

$$
I(z):=\oint_\gamma\frac1{\zeta-z}\,d\zeta
$$

and showing that $I(z)$ is independent of $z$, and that $I(z_0)=2\pi i$
