title: 'Definition 2.1.2 (Continuous complex curve)'
---

Let $\gamma:[a,b]\to\C$ be defined by $\gamma(t):=\gamma_1(t) +
i\gamma_2(t)$.

Then $\gamma$ is said to be continuous on $[a,b]$ if both $\gamma_1$
and $\gamma_2$ are.

The curve $\gamma$ is $C^1([a,b])$ if $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are
continuously differentiable on $[a,b]$. Under these circumstances we
will write

$$
\gamma'(t)=
\frac{d\gamma}{dt}=
\frac{d\gamma_1}{dt} + i\frac{d\gamma_2}{dt}
$$
