title: 'Theorem 2.2.3 (Holomorphism and directional derivatives)'
---

Let $f$ be holomorphic in a neighborhood $P\in\C$. Let $w_1,w_2\in\C$
have unit modulus. Consider the directional derivatives

$$
D_{w_1}f(P):=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{f(P+tw_1)-f(P)}t\\[0.5em]
D_{w_2}f(P):=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{f(P+tw_2)-f(P)}t
$$

Then

- (2.2.3.1) $|D_{w_1}f(P)|=|D_{w_2}f(P)|$
- (2.2.3.2) if $|f'(P)|\neq0$, then the directed angle from $w_1$ to
  $w_2$ equals the directed angle from $D_{w_1}f(P)$ to $D_{w_2}f(P)$.

Note:

- (2.2.3.1) alone implies that $f$ is holomorphic.
- (2.2.3.2) alone implies that $f$ is holomorphic.
