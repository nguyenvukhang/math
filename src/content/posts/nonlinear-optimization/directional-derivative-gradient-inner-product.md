title: 'Lemma 2.1.2 (Directional derivative and gradient)'
---

Let $D\subset \R^n$ be open and $f:D\to\R$
differentiable at $x\in D$. Then $f$ is directionally differentiable
at $x$ with

$$
f'(x;d) = \nabla f(x)^Td\quad\forall(d\in\R^n)
$$

Where $f'(x;d)$ is the [directional
derivative](#nonlinear-optimization/directional-derivative) of $f$ at
$x$ in the direction $d$.
