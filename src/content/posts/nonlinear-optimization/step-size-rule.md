Let $f:{\mathbb R}^n\to{\mathbb R}$ be continuously differentiable and
let $\mathcal{A}_f:=\{(x,d)\mid\nabla f(x)^Td<0\}$. A set-valued
mapping

$$
T:(x,d)\in\mathcal{A}_f\mapsto T(x,d)\subset\mathbb{R} _{++}
$$

is called a step-size rule for $f$.

We call it well-defined for $f$ if $T(x,d)\neq0\$ for all
$(x,d)\in\mathcal{A}\_f$.

If the step-size rule is well-defined for all continuously
differentiable functions ${\mathbb R}^n\to{\mathbb R}$, we simply call
it well-defined.
