title: 'Definition 2.1.1 (Directional derivative)'
---

Let $D\subset \mathbb R$ be open. $f:D\to\mathbb R$ is directionally
differentiable at $\bar x\in\mathbb R^n$ in the direction $d\in\mathbb
R^n$ if

$$
\lim_{t\downarrow0}\frac{f(\bar x + td) - f(x)}t
$$

exists. This limit is denoted by $f'(x;d)$ and is called the
directional derivative of $f$ at $\bar x$ in the direction $d$.

If $f$ is directionally differentiable at $\bar x$ in every direction
$d\in\mathbb R^n$, we call $f$ directionally differentiable at $\bar x$.

If $f$ is directionally differentiable at every $\bar x\in\mathbb
R^n$, we call it directionally differentiable.
