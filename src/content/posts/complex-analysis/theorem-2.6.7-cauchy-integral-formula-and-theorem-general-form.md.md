Let $U\subseteq\C$ be open. Let $f:U\to\C$ be holomorphic. Then

$$
\oint_\gamma f(z)\,dz = 0
$$

for any piecewise $C^1$ closed curve $\gamma$ in $U$ that can be
deformed in $U$ through closed curves to a closed curve lying entirely
in a disc contained in $U$.

In addition, suppose that $\bar D(z,r)\subseteq U$. Then

$$
\frac1{2\pi i}\oint_\gamma\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\,d\zeta=f(z)
$$

for any piecewise $C^1$ closed curve $\gamma$ in $U\setminus\{z\}$
that can be continuously deformed in $U\setminus\{z\}$ to $\partial
D(z,r)$ equipped with counterclockwise orientation.
