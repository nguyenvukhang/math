Let $U\subseteq\C$ be either an open rectangle or an open disc and let
$P\in U$. Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous, real-valued functions on $U$
which are continuously differentiable on $U\setminus\{P\}$. Suppose
further that

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}
\quad\text{on }U\setminus\{P\}
$$

Then there exists a $C^1$ function $h:U\to\R$ such that

$$
\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}=f,\quad
\frac{\partial h}{\partial y}=g
$$

at every point of $U$ (including $P$).
