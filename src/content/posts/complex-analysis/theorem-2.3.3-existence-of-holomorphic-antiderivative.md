open: true

Let $U\subseteq\C$ be either an open rectangle or an open disc. Let
$P\in U$ be fixed. Suppose that $F$ is continuous on $U$ and
holomorphic on $U\setminus\{P\}$. Then there is a holomorphic $H$ on
$U$ such that $\partial H/\partial z=F$.

Note that since $H$ is holomorphic, by [Theorem 2.2.1][2.2.1], we can
write $H'=F$.
