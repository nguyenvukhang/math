---

Let $U\subset\mathbb C$ be open. Let $f:U\to\C$ be in $C^2(U)$. $f$ is
said to be *harmonic* if

$$
\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y^2}=0
$$

The operator

$$
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}
$$

is called the *Laplace operator*, or *Laplacian*, and is denoted by
$\Delta$. We write

$$
\Delta f=
\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y^2}
$$
