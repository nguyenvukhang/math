If $\phi$ is a continuous function on $\{\zeta:|\zeta-P|=r\}$, then
the function $f$ given by

$$
f(z):=\frac1{2\pi
i}\oint_{|\zeta-P|=r}\frac{\phi(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\,d\zeta
$$

is defined and holomorphic on $D(P,r)$.

This theorem induces a very strong way to create a holomorphic
function. Instead of differentiability, we only need a continuous
$\phi$ to build a holomorphic $f$.
