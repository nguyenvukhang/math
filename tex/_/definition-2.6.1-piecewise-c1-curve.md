---

A piecewise $C^1$ curve $\gamma:[a,b]\to\C$ is a continuous function
such that there exists a finitne set of numbers $a_1\leq
a_2\leq\ldots\leq a_k$ satisfying $a_1=a$ and $a_k=b$, and with the
property that for every $i\leq j\leq k-1,\ \gamma|_{[a_j,a_{j+1}]}$ is
a $C^1$ curve.

$\gamma$ is a piecewise $C^1$ curve in an open set $U$ if
$\gamma([a,b])\subseteq U$.

Note that while joining $C^1(\R)$ curves may not lead to a piecewise
$C^1(\R)$ curve, doing it in $\C$ somehow works.
