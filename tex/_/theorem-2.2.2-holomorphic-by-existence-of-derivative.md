title: 'Theorem 2.2.2 (Holomorphic by existence of derivative)'
---

Let $U\subseteq\C$ be open. If $f\in C^1(U)$ and $f$ has a complex
derivative at each point of $U$, then $f$ is holomorphic on $U$.

In other words, if a continuous, complex-valued function $f$ on $U$ has
a complex derivative at each point and if $f'$ is continuous on $U$,
then $f$ is holomorphic on $U$.
