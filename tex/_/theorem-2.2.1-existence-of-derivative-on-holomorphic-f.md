title: "Theorem 2.2.1 (Existence of f' on holomorphic f)"
---

Let $U\subseteq\C$ be open and let $f$ be holomorphic on $U$. Then
$f'$ exists at each point of $U$ and

$$
f'(z)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}
$$

for all $z\in U$.

As a result of this theorem, we often will write $f'=\frac{\partial
f}{\partial z}$ when $f$ is holomorphic.
